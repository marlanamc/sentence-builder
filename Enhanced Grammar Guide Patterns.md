**Examples:**
- I have eaten pizza today (today isn't finished)

**Visual Time Guide:**
```
FINISHED TIME = PAST SIMPLE
|----yesterday----|----last week----|----2020----|
        ‚úì              ‚úì              ‚úì

UNFINISHED TIME = PRESENT PERFECT  
|----today (ongoing)----|----this week (ongoing)----|----since 2020----|
         ‚è≥                      ‚è≥                        ‚è≥
```

**Spanish Speaker Notes:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MAJOR ERROR:** "I have eaten yesterday" (using present perfect with finished time)
- ‚úÖ **THE RULE:** Yesterday = finished = past simple
- ‚úÖ **THE RULE:** Today = unfinished = present perfect
- üåâ **Bridge:** Spanish doesn't make this distinction as clearly
